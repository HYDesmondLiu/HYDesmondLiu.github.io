Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning
------
Recently, I read about [a paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3485128) discussing 
the approaches that we could tackle climate change with Machine Learning.

As practioners who implement ML/RL algorithms to deal with real-world problems, 
this paper is extremely important to us to think about how we leverage our knowledge 
to benefit all living creatures on this planet we live in.
