This paper proposes an adaptive policy regularization approach for transferring policies from offline datasets to online deployment in HVAC control. The method uses weighted increased simple moving average Q-value estimators to stabilize policy updates and improve safety during online fine-tuning.

Results show significant improvements over baseline methods in HVAC control benchmarks.
