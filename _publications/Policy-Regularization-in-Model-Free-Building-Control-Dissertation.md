This dissertation develops a novel policy regularization framework for reinforcement learning in HVAC control systems, focusing on safe and efficient operation in real-world settings. Contributions include methods for offline-to-online policy regularization, open-source building batch RL datasets for benchmarking, and empirical results demonstrating energy and performance improvements in building control tasks.

Key contributions:
- A comprehensive policy regularization framework applicable to offline, online, and offline-to-online RL.
- Release of the B2RL open-source building batch RL dataset to facilitate benchmarking.
- Empirical evaluation showing improved stability and sample-efficiency in HVAC control applications.
