Batch reinforcement learning (BRL) is an emerging research area
in the RL community. It learns exclusively from static datasets (i.e.
replay buffers) without interaction with the environment. In the
offline settings, existing replay experiences are used as prior knowledge
for BRL models to find the optimal policy. Thus, generating
replay buffers is crucial for BRL model benchmark. In our B2RL
(Building Batch RL) dataset, we collected real-world data from our
building management systems, as well as buffers generated by several
behavioral policies in simulation environments. We believe it
could help building experts on BRL research. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to open-source building datasets for the
purpose of BRL learning.
