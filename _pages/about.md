About me
======
![UCSD](/images/UCSD_Seal.png){: width="25%" style="float: right"}  

- I am an accomplished AI/ML researcher specializing in Deep Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. I have a proven track record of leveraging cutting-edge AI/ML technologies to tackle complex technical and business challenges, delivering innovative and impactful solutions.

- I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where my research focused on advancing the frontiers of AI and its practical applications.

- My PI is [Professor Rajesh K. Gupta](http://mesl.ucsd.edu/gupta/), and our lab is [Microelectronic Embedded Systems Laboratory (MESL)](http://mesl.ucsd.edu/).
