About me
======
I am a Ph.D. student at UC San Deigo. My PI is Professor Rajesh Gupta, our lab is MESL.  
My research focus is Batch/Offline Reinforcement Learning and its applications on Building systems.  

Research focus
======
* Offline-RL Regularization
  * Batch-RL (BRL) method needs no simulator, only prior transitions as replay buffer to learn the optimal policy. 
  Our Batch-Constrained Munchausen Q-learning (BCM) outperforms other BRL methods in real building multi-zone environments 
  during weeks of evaluation time period. It maximizes the energy efficiency and the occupantsâ€™ thermal comfort simultaneously.

Previous Experiences
======
* VLSI CAD with ML
  * Internship at Cadence Design Systems prototyping partitioning with ML clustering algorithm

* VLSI Analog Layout
  * Virtuoso L/XL/GXL, SKILL Programming

* TSMC R&D 
  * N20 interconnect OPC/DPT/DFM 

Misc.
======
I enjoy heavy metal music, baseball, hiking, and exploring natures.
