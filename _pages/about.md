About me
======
I am a Ph.D. student at University of California San Deigo (UCSD).  
My PI is [Professor Rajesh K. Gupta](http://mesl.ucsd.edu/gupta/),  
our lab is [Microelectronic Embedded Systems Laboratory (MESL)](http://mesl.ucsd.edu/).  
My research focus is Batch/Offline Reinforcement Learning and its applications on Building systems.  

Research focus
======
* **Combination of Model-based and Model-free BRL**
  * By simulating transitions via pre-trained ensembled environment dynamics models, we could create a "model buffer" to assist the BRL 
  training. We use deterministic TD3+BC model as our foundation.  

* **Offline-RL Regularization**
  * Batch-RL (BRL) method needs no simulator, only prior transitions as replay buffer to learn the optimal policy. 
  Our Batch-Constrained Munchausen Q-learning (BCM) outperforms other BRL methods in real building multi-zone environments 
  during weeks of evaluation time period. It maximizes the energy efficiency and the occupantsâ€™ thermal comfort simultaneously.
