About me
======
I am a Ph.D. student at UC San Deigo. My PI is [Professor Rajesh K. Gupta](http://mesl.ucsd.edu/gupta/),  
our lab is [Microelectronic Embedded Systems Laboratory (MESL)](http://mesl.ucsd.edu/).  
My research focus is Batch/Offline Reinforcement Learning and its applications on Building systems.  

Research focus
======
* **Offline-RL Regularization**
  * Batch-RL (BRL) method needs no simulator, only prior transitions as replay buffer to learn the optimal policy. 
  Our Batch-Constrained Munchausen Q-learning (BCM) outperforms other BRL methods in real building multi-zone environments 
  during weeks of evaluation time period. It maximizes the energy efficiency and the occupantsâ€™ thermal comfort simultaneously.

Previous Experiences
======
* **VLSI CAD with ML**
  * Cadence Design Systems Inc. 
  * Pprototyping partitioning with ML clustering (DBSCAN) algorithm

* **VLSI Analog Layout**
  * Cadence Design Systems Inc. 
  * Virtuoso L/XL/GXL, SKILL Programming

* **OPC/DFM/RET**
  * TSMC N20 BEOL OPC/DPT/DFM 

Misc.
======
I enjoy heavy metal music, baseball, hiking, and exploring natures.
