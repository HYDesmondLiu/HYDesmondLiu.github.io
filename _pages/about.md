About me
======
![UCSD](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/University_of_California%2C_San_Diego_seal.svg){: style="float: right"}  

I am a Ph.D. student at University of California San Deigo (UCSD).  
My PI is [Professor Rajesh K. Gupta](http://mesl.ucsd.edu/gupta/),  
our lab is [Microelectronic Embedded Systems Laboratory (MESL)](http://mesl.ucsd.edu/).  
My research focus is Batch/Offline Deep Reinforcement Learning and its applications.

Research focus
======
* **Batch Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL)**
![Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://offline-rl.github.io/assets/OFFLINE_RL.gif)
Agarwal, R., Schuurmans, D. & Norouzi, M.. (2020). An Optimistic Perspective on Offline Reinforcement Learning International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

* **Offline-RL Regularization (Papers published in NeurIPS Offline-RL Workshop 2021 and ICCPS 2022)**
  * Batch-RL (BRL) method needs no simulator, only prior transitions as replay buffer to learn the optimal policy. 
  Our Batch-Constrained Munchausen Q-learning (BCM) outperforms other BRL methods in real building multi-zone environments 
  during weeks of evaluation time period. It maximizes the energy efficiency and the occupantsâ€™ thermal comfort simultaneously.

Misc.
